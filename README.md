# Pigs Have Litters
Buff Pigs by making them have litters on breed!

Have you ever felt that Pigs are lonely because Cows, Sheep, and Chickens are strictly better for farming due to the benefitial extra drops? This mod attempts to encourage the player to interact with Pigs by increasing the count of Piglets they produce (since Pigs IRL also have litters).

The chances for Pig's litter sizes are currently:
- 30% chance for 2
- 50% chance for 3
- 15% chance for 4
- 4% chance for 5
- 1% chance for 6
